# Local Jarvis - Agent Instructions

## Overview

macOS menu bar companion app. Lives entirely in the macOS status bar (no dock icon, no main window). Clicking the menu bar icon opens a custom floating panel with companion voice controls. Uses push-to-talk (ctrl+option) to capture voice input, transcribes it via AssemblyAI streaming, and sends the transcript + a screenshot of the user's screen to Claude. Claude responds with text (streamed via SSE) and voice (ElevenLabs TTS). A blue cursor overlay can fly to and point at UI elements Claude references on any connected monitor.

All API keys live on a Cloudflare Worker proxy — nothing sensitive ships in the app.

## Architecture

- **App Type**: Menu bar-only (`LSUIElement=true`), no dock icon or main window
- **Framework**: SwiftUI (macOS native) with AppKit bridging for menu bar panel and cursor overlay
- **Pattern**: MVVM with `@StateObject` / `@Published` state management
- **AI Chat**: Claude (Sonnet 4.6 default, Opus 4.6 optional) via Cloudflare Worker proxy with SSE streaming
- **Speech-to-Text**: AssemblyAI real-time streaming (`u3-rt-pro` model) via websocket, with OpenAI and Apple Speech as fallbacks
- **Text-to-Speech**: ElevenLabs (`eleven_flash_v2_5` model) via Cloudflare Worker proxy
- **Screen Capture**: ScreenCaptureKit (macOS 14.2+), multi-monitor support
- **Voice Input**: Push-to-talk via `AVAudioEngine` + pluggable transcription-provider layer. System-wide keyboard shortcut via listen-only CGEvent tap.
- **Element Pointing**: Claude embeds `[POINT:x,y:label:screenN]` tags in responses. The overlay parses these, maps coordinates to the correct monitor, and animates the blue cursor along a bezier arc to the target.
- **Concurrency**: `@MainActor` isolation, async/await throughout
- **Analytics**: PostHog via `ClickyAnalytics.swift`

### API Proxy (Cloudflare Worker)

The app never calls external APIs directly. All requests go through a Cloudflare Worker (`worker/src/index.ts`) that holds the real API keys as secrets.

| Route | Upstream | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `POST /chat` | `api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` | Claude vision + streaming chat |
| `POST /tts` | `api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{voiceId}` | ElevenLabs TTS audio |
| `POST /transcribe-token` | `streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/token` | Fetches a short-lived (480s) AssemblyAI websocket token |

Worker secrets: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
Worker vars: `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`

### Key Architecture Decisions

**Menu Bar Panel Pattern**: The companion panel uses `NSStatusItem` for the menu bar icon and a custom borderless `NSPanel` for the floating control panel. This gives full control over appearance (dark, rounded corners, custom shadow) and avoids the standard macOS menu/popover chrome. The panel is non-activating so it doesn't steal focus. A global event monitor auto-dismisses it on outside clicks.

**Cursor Overlay**: A full-screen transparent `NSPanel` hosts the blue cursor companion. It's non-activating, joins all Spaces, and never steals focus. The cursor position, response text, waveform, and pointing animations all render in this overlay via SwiftUI through `NSHostingView`.

**Global Push-To-Talk Shortcut**: Background push-to-talk uses a listen-only `CGEvent` tap instead of an AppKit global monitor so modifier-based shortcuts like `ctrl + option` are detected more reliably while the app is running in the background.

**Shared URLSession for AssemblyAI**: A single long-lived `URLSession` is shared across all AssemblyAI streaming sessions (owned by the provider, not the session). Creating and invalidating a URLSession per session corrupts the OS connection pool and causes "Socket is not connected" errors after a few rapid reconnections.

**Transient Cursor Mode**: When "Show Clicky" is off, pressing the hotkey fades in the cursor overlay for the duration of the interaction (recording → response → TTS → optional pointing), then fades it out automatically after 1 second of inactivity. The user-facing name will be migrated to Jarvis in later phases.

**Jarvis Computer-Use Agent Loop**: Jarvis executes commands through a local observe-act loop instead of planning everything upfront. Each iteration captures a fresh screenshot, asks the local Qwen3-VL model (via Ollama) for the single next action on a relative 1000x1000 coordinate grid, maps coordinates to global screen points, gates the action through the safety policy, executes it, and repeats (max 15 steps) until the model terminates, answers, or the user cancels. A single multimodal model (`qwen3-vl:8b-instruct` default — the bare `qwen3-vl:8b` tag is the thinking variant, which is far too slow and returns empty JSON content) handles voice intent routing, agent turns, and screen-aware answers. Ollama must run natively (the menu bar app), not in Docker: Docker on macOS has no GPU access, making 8B vision inference take minutes instead of seconds. Screen-independent commands (open app, hotkey, type, screenshot) still run instantly through the deterministic rule planner without any model call. Failed actions do not abort the run — the model sees the failure in its history plus a fresh screenshot and can try another way.

## Key Files

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `leanring_buddyApp.swift` | ~89 | Menu bar app entry point. Uses `@NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor` with `CompanionAppDelegate` which creates `MenuBarPanelManager` and starts `CompanionManager`. No main window — the app lives entirely in the status bar. |
| `CompanionManager.swift` | ~1142 | Central state machine. Owns dictation, shortcut monitoring, screen capture, local Jarvis voice routing, local system speech responses, and overlay management. Tracks voice state (idle/listening/processing/responding), conversation history, local model selection, and cursor visibility. Push-to-talk transcripts route through the Jarvis computer-use agent loop. Vision answers can escalate to a one-shot browser search via a `[SEARCH:query]` tag when the requested live information is not on screen. |
| `MenuBarPanelManager.swift` | ~243 | NSStatusItem + custom NSPanel lifecycle. Creates the menu bar icon, manages the floating companion panel (show/hide/position), installs click-outside-to-dismiss monitor. |
| `CompanionPanelView.swift` | ~973 | SwiftUI panel content for the menu bar dropdown. Shows companion status, push-to-talk instructions, model picker (Sonnet/Opus), Jarvis text command box with workflow progress, permissions UI, DM feedback button, and quit button. Dark aesthetic using `DS` design system. |
| `OverlayWindow.swift` | ~881 | Full-screen transparent overlay hosting the blue cursor, response text, waveform, and spinner. Handles cursor animation, element pointing with bezier arcs, multi-monitor coordinate mapping, and fade-out transitions. |
| `CompanionResponseOverlay.swift` | ~217 | SwiftUI view for the response text bubble and waveform displayed next to the cursor in the overlay. |
| `CompanionScreenCaptureUtility.swift` | ~132 | Multi-monitor screenshot capture using ScreenCaptureKit. Returns labeled image data for each connected display. |
| `BuddyDictationManager.swift` | ~866 | Push-to-talk voice pipeline. Handles microphone capture via `AVAudioEngine`, provider-aware permission checks, keyboard/button dictation sessions, transcript finalization, shortcut parsing, contextual keyterms, and live audio-level reporting for waveform feedback. |
| `BuddyTranscriptionProvider.swift` | ~100 | Protocol surface and provider factory for voice transcription backends. Resolves provider based on `VoiceTranscriptionProvider` in Info.plist — AssemblyAI, OpenAI, or Apple Speech. |
| `AssemblyAIStreamingTranscriptionProvider.swift` | ~478 | Streaming transcription provider. Fetches temp tokens from the Cloudflare Worker, opens an AssemblyAI v3 websocket, streams PCM16 audio, tracks turn-based transcripts, and delivers finalized text on key-up. Shares a single URLSession across all sessions. |
| `OpenAIAudioTranscriptionProvider.swift` | ~317 | Upload-based transcription provider. Buffers push-to-talk audio locally, uploads as WAV on release, returns finalized transcript. |
| `AppleSpeechTranscriptionProvider.swift` | ~147 | Local fallback transcription provider backed by Apple's Speech framework. |
| `BuddyAudioConversionSupport.swift` | ~108 | Audio conversion helpers. Converts live mic buffers to PCM16 mono audio and builds WAV payloads for upload-based providers. |
| `GlobalPushToTalkShortcutMonitor.swift` | ~132 | System-wide push-to-talk monitor. Owns the listen-only `CGEvent` tap and publishes press/release transitions. |
| `ClaudeAPI.swift` | ~291 | Claude vision API client with streaming (SSE) and non-streaming modes. TLS warmup optimization, image MIME detection, conversation history support. |
| `OpenAIAPI.swift` | ~142 | OpenAI GPT vision API client. |
| `ElevenLabsTTSClient.swift` | ~81 | ElevenLabs TTS client. Sends text to the Worker proxy, plays back audio via `AVAudioPlayer`. Exposes `isPlaying` for transient cursor scheduling. |
| `ElementLocationDetector.swift` | ~182 | Legacy screenshot element detector (local Ollama vision). No longer on the active Jarvis path — the computer-use agent grounds its own clicks. |
| `DesignSystem.swift` | ~880 | Design system tokens — colors, corner radii, shared styles. All UI references `DS.Colors`, `DS.CornerRadius`, etc. |
| `ClickyAnalytics.swift` | ~121 | PostHog analytics integration for usage tracking. |
| `WindowPositionManager.swift` | ~262 | Window placement logic, Screen Recording permission flow, and accessibility permission helpers. |
| `AppBundleConfiguration.swift` | ~28 | Runtime configuration reader for keys stored in the app bundle Info.plist. |
| `JarvisAssistantManager.swift` | ~271 | Jarvis coordinator. Screen-independent commands run through the deterministic rule planner for instant execution; everything else runs through the computer-use agent loop. Mirrors agent progress into observable workflow state for the panel and returns explicit spoken results. |
| `JarvisComputerUseAgent.swift` | ~507 | Local observe-act agent loop. Captures a fresh screenshot each step, asks Qwen3-VL for the single next action (1000x1000 relative coordinate grid), maps coordinates to global screen points, applies the safety policy, executes, and repeats up to 15 steps. Terminal actions: answer, terminate. |
| `JarvisComputerUseTools.swift` | ~340 | Mouse, scroll, and timing tools completing the human-equivalent action set: double_click, right_click, drag, move_mouse, scroll, and wait. CGEvent-based, converting AppKit global coordinates to Quartz before posting. |
| `JarvisDebugLogger.swift` | ~55 | Verbose console logging for the Jarvis pipeline. All lines use the `🐛 [Jarvis:<category>]` prefix for Xcode console filtering. |
| `JarvisPlanner.swift` | ~292 | Planner protocol plus the rule-based planner for screen-independent fast-path commands like open app, type text, press hotkey, search, and screenshot. |
| `JarvisLocalLLMClient.swift` | ~330 | Ollama-compatible local LLM client. Defaults to `qwen3-vl:8b-instruct` for both text and vision, reads model/base URL overrides from UserDefaults (migrating legacy/thinking tags away), and provides the JSON-enforced computer-use agent turn call used by both the agent loop and the voice intent router. |
| `JarvisLocalLLMPlanner.swift` | ~200 | Legacy one-shot local planner (rules then Ollama JSON planning). No longer on the active path — superseded by the computer-use agent loop. |
| `JarvisClaudePlannerClient.swift` | ~120 | Legacy cloud fallback planner client. Not used on the active local-first path. |
| `JarvisVoiceIntentRouter.swift` | ~153 | Local LLM router classifying spoken transcripts as action, vision, or action-then-vision before dispatching to the agent loop or the screen-aware companion response. |
| `JarvisWorkflowState.swift` | ~53 | Observable multi-step workflow model with per-step pending/running/succeeded/failed state. |
| `JarvisTool.swift` | ~147 | Shared Jarvis tool contracts: argument values, tool definitions, tool calls, execution context, structured results, and typed argument helpers. |
| `JarvisToolRegistry.swift` | ~35 | Registry for local macOS tools available to Jarvis. Phase 2 registers the first app, keyboard, and screenshot tools through `JarvisPhaseTwoToolInstaller`. |
| `JarvisSafetyPolicy.swift` | ~61 | Central allow/confirm/block decisions for planned Jarvis tool calls. |
| `JarvisPhaseTwoTools.swift` | ~351 | Core executable local tools for Jarvis: open app, type text, press hotkeys, take screenshots, and click screen coordinates. Its installer also registers the computer-use tools from `JarvisComputerUseTools.swift`. |
| `JarvisPhaseOneMap.md` | ~29 | Maps existing macOS app components to the Jarvis input, assistant, tool, output, and configuration layers. |
| `worker/src/index.ts` | ~178 | Cloudflare Worker proxy. Routes: `/chat` (Claude), `/detect-element` (Claude Computer Use), `/tts` (ElevenLabs), `/transcribe-token` (AssemblyAI temp token). |

## Build & Run

```bash
# Open in Xcode
open leanring-buddy.xcodeproj

# Select the leanring-buddy scheme, set signing team, Cmd+R to build and run

# Known non-blocking warnings: Swift 6 concurrency warnings,
# deprecated onChange warning in OverlayWindow.swift. Do NOT attempt to fix these.
```

**Do NOT run `xcodebuild` from the terminal** — it invalidates TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) permissions and the app will need to re-request screen recording, accessibility, etc.

## Code Style & Conventions

### Variable and Method Naming

IMPORTANT: Follow these naming rules strictly. Clarity is the top priority.

- Be as clear and specific with variable and method names as possible
- **Optimize for clarity over concision.** A developer with zero context on the codebase should immediately understand what a variable or method does just from reading its name
- Use longer names when it improves clarity. Do NOT use single-character variable names
- Example: use `originalQuestionLastAnsweredDate` instead of `originalAnswered`
- When passing props or arguments to functions, keep the same names as the original variable. Do not shorten or abbreviate parameter names. If you have `currentCardData`, pass it as `currentCardData`, not `card` or `cardData`

### Code Clarity

- **Clear is better than clever.** Do not write functionality in fewer lines if it makes the code harder to understand
- Write more lines of code if additional lines improve readability and comprehension
- Make things so clear that someone with zero context would completely understand the variable names, method names, what things do, and why they exist
- When a variable or method name alone cannot fully explain something, add a comment explaining what is happening and why

### Swift/SwiftUI Conventions

- Use SwiftUI for all UI unless a feature is only supported in AppKit (e.g., `NSPanel` for floating windows)
- All UI state updates must be on `@MainActor`
- Use async/await for all asynchronous operations
- Comments should explain "why" not just "what", especially for non-obvious AppKit bridging
- AppKit `NSPanel`/`NSWindow` bridged into SwiftUI via `NSHostingView`
- All buttons must show a pointer cursor on hover
- For any interactive element, explicitly think through its hover behavior (cursor, visual feedback, and whether hover should communicate clickability)

### Do NOT

- Do not add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked
- Do not add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you did not change
- Do not try to fix the known non-blocking warnings (Swift 6 concurrency, deprecated onChange)
- Do not rename the project directory or scheme (the "leanring" typo is intentional/legacy)
- Do not run `xcodebuild` from the terminal — it invalidates TCC permissions

## Git Workflow

- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
- Commit messages: imperative mood, concise, explain the "why" not the "what"
- Do not force-push to main
